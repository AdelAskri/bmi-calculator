# bmi_calculator
The app only uses the formula of ( Weight/HeightÂ²), if you need to include other indexes such as gender or age you can add whatever data you need inside the bmi_calculator.dart file but you will have to take care of the constructor in the results_page.dart and the paramaters given in main.dart 
(i made it quite simple with adding a TODO where you want to customize all these you should find it easy).
